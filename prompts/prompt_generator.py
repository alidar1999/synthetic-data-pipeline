    Generate a base template to instruct the model to write a Raspberry Pi C code prompt.

    You are a specialized prompt engineer for Raspberry Pi pico programming. Create a detailed, creative coding prompt for a C program that uses the {subcategory} {category} on a {pi_model}.

    The prompt should be specific, technical, and highly detailed. Include:
    1. The exact type of {subcategory} {category} hardware (e.g., DHT11, BMP180, PIR)
    2. Specific C libraries for Raspberry Pi or system calls to use (e.g., wiringPi, pigpio, bcm2835, sysfs)
    3. What the code should accomplish (e.g., read data, log to file, send over UART, control something)
    4. Error handling for failed reads or GPIO init or I2C or SPI Communication
    5. File format for saving results if applicable (only for an example with saving data)
    6. Real-world use case for context (e.g., environment monitoring, safety system)
    7. Specifically designed for {pi_model}

    ðŸ”¹ Example Format to Follow:
    Write a C program for Raspberry Pi 'verion' to read data from a DHT11 sensor connected to GPIO7 and write the readings to a CSV file named 'sensor_log.csv'.
    
    Further requirements:
    Make your prompt interesting, technically accurate, and include an innovative approach or twist that would make this code example stand out.
    Avoid buzzwords, over-explaining, or adding advanced goals. Just give a natural developer-style prompt.
    Try to keep this prompt direct, minimum with only relevant information and maximum two lines. The prompt shouldn't be more than 2 lines and you should be able to explain in 2 lines.
    
    Provide ONLY the prompt in plain text, formatted as a direct instruction to a C developer. Do not include any meta-commentary or notes about the prompt itself.

    Enhance the following prompt with specific implementation details:

    Add these requirements:
    1. Code should use {style} programming style
    2. Complexity level should be {complexity}
    3. Specifically designed for {pi_model}
    4. Should implement {integration} approach
    5. The use context is: {context}
    6. Code should strictly be in C language and use libraries that support C programming.
    7. Donot use dummy libraries or non-standard libraries (such as sensor.h) etc.
    8. Donot refer to any C++ libraries in the code which cannot be used in a C program.
    9. For Wiring access, I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO usage, refer to latest libraries such as wiringPi, pigpio, bcm2835, sysfs. DONOT Use older libraries as the code is not compatible with newer packages.
    10. Try to use packages and libraries publicly available and the ones that you have in your knowledge, dont use complex hard to find libraries.s
    
    ðŸ“Œ Format your final output like this example (structure only, not content):

    Write a C program for Raspberry Pi 'version' using the pigpio library to read a digital PIR motion sensor connected to GPIO17. When motion is detected, the program should log the timestamp to a file and blink an LED connected to GPIO27 for 1 second. The program should use procedural programming style, target Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, and be suitable for a home security system in a smart home setup. It should include proper signal handling for graceful shutdown and validate sensor readings before acting.

    Make the prompt cohesive, technical, and detailed. Ensure it specifies exact libraries, functions, and implementation details.
    Format as a direct instruction to a developer. Return ONLY the final enhanced prompt.
